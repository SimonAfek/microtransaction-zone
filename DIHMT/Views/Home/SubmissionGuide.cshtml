    <h4>Basically, this game…</h4>
    <p>
        Finish the sentence with a short overview of the game's microtransactions. This should either summarize the detailed description or highlight something particularly notable. Clever or funny quips are accepted, but aren't necessary.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            "Basically, <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Game", new { id = 18162 })">Team Fortress 2</a>... has a myriad of ways to spend money on iPod earbuds"
        </li>
        <li>
            "Basically, <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Game", new { id = 46569 })">Bloodborne</a>... has a beefy, paid expansion and nothing else"
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 name="detailedinfo">Detailed Info</h4>
    <p>
        This is where you'll describe the specifics of the game's microtransactions. The description should be informative, not opinionated, aiming for as much objectivity as possible.
        There's no length requirement, so if your write-up is short but says what it needs to, that's great. Some questions you might ask yourself when writing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Is my description straightforward enough that it can be understood by someone who's never played this game?</b>
            It can be a bad idea to get too deep into minutiae that isn't easily understood by someone who hasn't played the game before.
            Sometimes, getting <i>too</i> detailed can make your write-up harder to parse and understand for someone who isn't intimately familiar with a game's labyrinth of currencies, reward systems, and microtransactions.
        </li>
        <li><b>What is the most important/notable microtransaction?</b> For instance, a mandatory subscription fee is more important than cosmetic DLC.</li>
        <li><b>What are the microtransactions?</b> Describe the flags you picked. If it's cosmetic DLC, is it skins, vehicles, etc.?</li>
        <li>
            <b>How do you pay for the microtransactions?</b>
            <ul>
                <li>In game currency: If it takes a long time to unlock something this way, mention it.</li>
                <li>
                    Real money (or points bought with real money): If it's 1 item type, how much does it normally cost? If it's multiple, what's the price range? If possible, these prices should be listed in USD.
                    If you can't access U.S. prices, go ahead and leave out the numbers for another user to fill in.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>For those games whose crimes are especially heinous:</b> If the game reaches prerelease Star Wars: Battlefront II badness, it can be tempting to tear it apart. Fortunately for us, you don't have to&mdash;
            people will understand when they read it takes 40 hours to unlock a character without dipping into microtransactions. Let their Sins speak for themselves.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Links</h4>

    <p>
        Here, you can add links about the game and its microtransactions. You might want to add links to a page that goes into more detail about the items for sale or a video that covers the microtransactions in depth.
