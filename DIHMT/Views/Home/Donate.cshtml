    <h1>Donations</h1>

    <p><b>MICROTRANSACTION.ZONE</b> is a strictly non-commercial endeavor. The site will remain free to use for as long as it exists, and we do not monetize our users through advertisements or data tracking.
    It costs money to keep it running, though&mdash;domain names and hosting don't come for free. And it takes time to develop and maintain.</p>

    <p>If you feel that <b>MICROTRANSACTION.ZONE</b> has been useful to you, you are welcome to leave a donation via one of the links on this page. Donations are greatly appreciated, but 100% optional! 
    Donations will be used to cover the site's upkeep. Any surplus beyond this will go to the developers and maintainers listed on our <a href="@Url.Action("About")" target="_blank">About</a> page.</p>

    <p>We guarantee that no matter how much or how often you donate, you will get absolutely nothing in return&mdash;not even a shoutout in the credits of our next YouTube video.</p>
