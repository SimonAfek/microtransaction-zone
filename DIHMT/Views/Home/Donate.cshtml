<h2>Donations</h2>

<p>
    <strong>MICROTRANSACTION.ZONE</strong> is a strictly not-for-profit operation. The site, and all of its features, will remain free to use for the entirety of its existence.
    It costs money to keep it running, though - domain names and hosting don't come for free. And it takes time to develop and maintain.
</p>

<p>
    If you feel that <strong>MICROTRANSACTION.ZONE</strong> has been useful to you, and you wish to help contribute to keeping it running, you can do so by donating via one of the links on this page.
    Donations are appreciated, but 100% optional.
</p>

<p>
    Donations will be used to cover the site's upkeep.
    Any surplus beyond this will go to the developers and maintainers listed on our <a href="@Url.Action("About")" target="_blank">About</a>-page.
</p>

<p>
    We guarantee that no matter how much or how often you donate, you will get absolutely nothing in return. Not even a shoutout in the credits of our next YouTube video.
</p>
